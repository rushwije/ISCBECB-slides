# Realization #1- The knowledge gap

--

Going from an undergraduate to a PhD is a massive adjustment 

--

I had to catch up to a lot of new work and new techniques/skills

```

# Realization #2-People Skills

--
Establishing professional relationships all from day one from scratch 

--

Use all opportunities
- Join a students’ association
- Choose to not work from home
- Conferences

```
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}

# Realization #3- It's a long haul

--

I was anxious because I felt like I had a lot to do to catch-up

--

I couldn’t evaluate whether I was doing well

--

Set smaller milestones to track progress

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("gifs/Brace.jpeg")
```

# Realization #4-Aiming for perfection

--

“Best is the enemy of the good”

--

Get feedback whenever possible from supervisors


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("gifs/feedback.jpeg")
```


---

# Realization #5-Growing thicker skin

--

I had to teach myself to handle constructive criticism 

--

This is a very important skill because your work will continuously get critiqued

# Realization#6- There is a steep learning curve

--

First year was slow and challenging

--

Comparatively the second and third years have been easier

# Taking the leap

--

Timing- If you spot your ideal PhD straight away, it could make sense to apply

Same applies for funding too
